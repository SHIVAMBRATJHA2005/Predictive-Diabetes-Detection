## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, outliers using MAD (Median Absolute Deviation), and ensures column consistency.  
- 📊 **Visualization**: Exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations in features.  
- 🤖 **Model Benchmarking**: Evaluation of four machine learning classifiers:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine  
- 🌐 **Deployment**: Interactive Streamlit web application for real-time prediction with feedback animations and medical disclaimers.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Missing data imputed with appropriate strategies; outliers handled using MAD.  
2. **Model Selection**: Several models evaluated — Logistic Regression chosen for best balance of accuracy and interpretability.  
3. **Deployment**: Inputs from users (age, BMI, health metrics) are passed through the trained model to predict diabetes risk in real-time.
